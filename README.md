ðŸ”Ž **Manikure is a single-page web application for designing Kubernetes resource definitions (JSON/YAML manifests).** It's ideal for when you're learning how to write Kubernetes resources, or when you want to quickly prototype a new resource.

## Features

- **Interactive editor:** Design your Kubernetes resources using a visual editor, without writing YAML.
- **Templates:** Use pre-defined templates to get started quickly. Choose from a set of typical Kubernetes scenarios.
- **Export:** Export your resources as YAML, ready to apply to your Kubernetes cluster.
- **Share:** Share your resources with others, by exporting them as a URL.
- **Dark mode:** Because everyone loves dark mode.
- **No server required:** The app runs entirely in your browser, with no server-side processing.

## Future roadmap

- [ ] Support for more fields in the core objects (Pod, Deployment, Service)
- [x] Support for dynamic fields in objects (e.g. environment variables, volumes) (implemented using Zod/AutoForm)
- [ ] Combine multiple objects into a Kubernetes List or OpenShift Template
- [ ] Support for creating Helm charts
- [x] Make it look nicer (Now done using shadcn-vue!)

## Getting started

### Use in your browser

You can use Manikure in your browser without having to install it.

Simply head to https://manikure.netlify.app.

### Run locally

If you want to build and run this application locally, you'll need _npm_ installed:

```shell
# Install
npm install

# Compile and hot-reload for development (starts a web server and enables hot-reload):
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:5173`.

If you want to create a production build of the application (builds the application's HTML, CSS and JS into the `dist/` folder):

```
npm run build
```
