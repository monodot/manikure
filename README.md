# ðŸ’… manikure - Manifest Builder for Kubernetes Resources

ðŸ”Ž **A single-page web application for creating Kubernetes resource definitions (JSON/YAML manifests).** Built with: VueJS, TailwindCSS, sweat+tears.

> This is a personal project, developed when I realised I was fed up of writing Kubernetes manifests all the time. This project is also my playground for learning modern front-end development (I'm normally a back-end engineer so this is a bit of a change for me!) ðŸ‘´ I don't work on this project regularly but will be coming back to it infrequently to update and add new features. Your issues and pull requests are welcome!

**Latest news (24/09/2023):** I've just updated this to Vue v3. `npm` sapped my will to live.

## Future roadmap

- Support for more fields in the core objects (Pod, Deployment, Service)
- Support for dynamic fields in objects (e.g. environment variables, volumes)
- Combine multiple objects into a Kubernetes List or OpenShift Template
- Support for creating Helm charts
- Make it look nicer

## Project setup

If you want to build and run this application locally, you'll need NPM installed:

```

```

Compile and minify for production (builds the application into the `dist/` folder):
