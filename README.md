# ðŸ’… manikure - Manifest Builder for Kubernetes Resources
### **Try it out:** https://manikure.netlify.app

ðŸ”Ž **Manikure is a single-page web application for creating Kubernetes resource definitions (JSON/YAML manifests).** It's built with VueJS, TailwindCSS, blood, sweat and tears.

> This is a personal project, developed when I grew fed up of writing Kubernetes manifests all the time. This project is also my playground for learning modern front-end development (I'm normally a back-end engineer so this is a bit of a change for me!) ðŸ‘´ I don't work on this project regularly, but in fits and starts. I come back to it infrequently, to update and add new features. Your issues and pull requests are welcome!

**Latest news (06/01/2025):** Updated the app to use shadcn-vue components, and Zod schema.

## Future roadmap

- [ ] Support for more fields in the core objects (Pod, Deployment, Service)
- [x] Support for dynamic fields in objects (e.g. environment variables, volumes) (implemented using Zod/AutoForm)
- [ ] Combine multiple objects into a Kubernetes List or OpenShift Template
- [ ] Support for creating Helm charts
- [x] Make it look nicer (Now done using shadcn-vue!)
